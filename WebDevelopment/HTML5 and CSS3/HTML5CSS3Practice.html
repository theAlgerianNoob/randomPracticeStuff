	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">The Header Element</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">The header element is a new way to define the header of a website. Normally you would use div followed by id then write header, but with HTML5 you can simply do that in the body element.</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">The Footer Element</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">The footer element is usually found at the bottom of the site. Stuff like contact details and other minor details can be found in the footer.</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">The Nav Element</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">The nav element is a new element added to HTML5. It represents a section of the page that links the user to navigate to other pages or a certain section wihtin the page. For example:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>

	<nav>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#">Weblink 1</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">Weblink 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">Weblink 3</a></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Making Circles</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">In CSS3, you can manipulate the rectangles and turn them into circles using "border-radius" as seen below:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p class="Circles"></p>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Making Box Shadows</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">In CSS3 you can also add shadows to your box elements using the box shadow element. With this element, there is a specific order the values are placed in.</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Horizonatl Offset</li>
		<li>Vertical Offset</li>
		<li>Blur</li>
		<li>Spread</li>
		<li>Colour</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="boxSection">With the exception of the blur values, all the other values can be a negative value to give a shadow in the opposite direction. The two examples below will demonstrate how the box shadows will work. The first example is with positive values while the second example will have negative values, again with the exception of the blur value.</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p class="PosBoxShadow"></p>
	<p><br></p>
	<p class="NegBoxShadow"></p>
	<p class="boxSection">With the box shadow element, you can also insert a shadow within the element. This can be done by simply adding the "inset" attribute befaore adding the other values such as size and colour. Here is an example:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p class="InnerShadow"></p>
	<p class="boxSection">In addition to inner shadows, you can add multiple layers of shadows for one box by simply adding a comma. You can have multiple inner shadows or outer shadows. here are two examples, the first with two inner shadows and the second with three outer shadows:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p>Example 1:</p>
	<p class="MultiLayered1"></p>
	<p>Example 2:</p>
	<p class="MultiLayered2"></p>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Adding Text Shadow</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">Similar to boxes, shadows can also be added onto text, either one layer or multiple layers of shadows can be added. Here are two examples of shadows being added to text. The image below shows how the text shadow property is applied:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p class="txtShadowImg"></p>
	<p>For this first example, a shadow is being added to this heading.</p>
	<h2 class="txtShadow1">Text Shadow 1</h2>
	<p>For this second example, I will add another layer of shadow onto the first example.</p>
	<h2 class="txtShadow2">Text Shadow 1</h2>
	<p>Note however, there are a few things that are needed to be taken into consideration when making shadows for texts:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>When you place a shadow close to the text, it is usually not as blurred as when you place a shadow further away from the text. </li>
		<li>When you place a shadow that is close, it implies one of the three things. Either the underlying surface is close, the light source is close or both the underlying surface and light source is close.</li>
		<li>A shadow that is close usually is darker compared to a shadow that is distant because less light can get in between the shape and the underlying surface.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">The Transparency Effect</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">With CSS3, you can add a cool transparency effect for, for example, a navigation bar. Here is an example of a navigation bar:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<nav class="navBar">
		<ul class="navBarBackground">
			<li class="linkLayout"><a href="#" class="navLink">Link 1</a></li>
			<li class="linkLayout"><a href="#" class="navLink">Link 2</a></li>
			<li class="linkLayout"><a href="#" class="navLink">Link 3</a></li>
			
		</ul>
	</nav>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">The Article Element</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">The article element is an element that allows you to store an article within the body element. This works very similar to the div element in HTML4. The structure of the article element works as follows:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p class="ArticleImg"></p>
	<article>
		<h1 class="headingVar">This is a mock article</h1>
		<section>
			<p>This is a section. You usually add content in this part of the article.</p>
		</section>
		<aside>
			<p>This is the aside part where you would have your secondary information.</p>
		</aside>
	</article>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Adding Audio</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">With HTML5 you can add audio to your site. And there are two ways to do so. The first uses the source atribute while the second uses "source" element inside the audio element. Here are the examples below:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p>Example 1:</p>
	<audio src="StarFall.mp3" controls autoplay>This text here will shwo up if your browser does not support the format.</audio>
	<p>Example 2:</p>
	<audio controls loop>
		<source src="StarFall.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
	</audio>
	<p>With the audio controls element you can make the audio autoplay or loop by simply writing "autoplay" or "loop" in the audio element. As seen above.</p>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Adding Video</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">Similar to audio, video can also be added in the same two different ways. And have two specific values Autoplay and Loop. Here are the two examples:</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p>Example 1:</p>
	<video controls autoplay>
		<source src="test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Video is not supported by your browser
	</video>
	<p>Example 2:</p>
	<video controls loop>
   		<source src="test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   		Video is not supported by your browser
	</video>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Adding a Progress Bar</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">Progress bars can also be added onto HTML5 however, they usually work in conjunction with javascript to dynamically display a tasks progress. However, for this example we will just set a value. There are two attributes within the progress bar element, "max" and "value". max specifies how much work the task needs in order to complete. And value specifies how much of the task has been completed. The example below will show a progress bar at 65% completed.</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p>Progress bar at 65%:</p><progress min="0" value="65" max="100"></progress>

	<hr>
	<h2 class="headingVar">Psuedo Classes and Elements</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="boxSection">In CSS3, Psuedo-Classes is a technique that allow us to style elements or just part of teh element, that exists within a document tree without using any scripts such as JavaScript. Psuedo-Elements are used to select specifc parts of an element. In order to use either Psuedo-Class or Psuedo-Element you use semi-colons. For the Psuedo-Class you use one semi-colon ":", with Psuedo-Element you use two "::".</p>
	<p class="clearBox"></p>
	<p>There are two commonly used psuedo classes; there is the ":first-child" class, and there is the ":last-child" class. The ":first-child" class matches an element that is the first child element of some other element. The ":last-child" class matches an element that is the last child element of some other element. In the example below, you will see the first-child of parent one and the last-child of parent 2 highlighted in green.</p>
	<h4>Parent 1</h4>
	<div id="parent1">
		<p>This paragraph is the first child of the parent1</p>
		<p>This paragraph is the middle child of the parent1</p>
		<p>This paragraph is the last child of the parent1</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Parent 2</h4>
	<div id="parent2">
		<p>This paragraph is the first child of the parent2</p>
		<p>This paragraph is the middle child of the parent2</p>
		<p>This paragraph is the last child of the parent2</p>
	</div>
	<p>With Psuedo-Elements, Their are 5 different elements that can be used. The image below reveals the five Psuedo Elements:</p>
	<p class="PsuedoElementsImg"></p>
	<p class="PsuedoElementExample">Now if you were to select this text here, you will see that it is different you were to select the other texts above. In fact for this text, it will highlight green with white text one it.</p>
