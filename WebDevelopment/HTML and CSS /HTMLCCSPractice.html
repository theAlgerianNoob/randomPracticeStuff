		<hr />

		<p>There are two types of font family names:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Font-Family</li>
			<li>Generic-Family</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The font-family is a specific font family like new times roman or arial.</p>
		<p>The generic-family is a group of font families with a similar look like serif or monospace.</p>

		<p>The following texts are written with generic family and font family fonts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p class="serif">This paragraph is written in Serif</p></li>
			<li><p class="sansserif">This paragraph is written in Sans-Serif</p></li>
			<li><p class="monospace">The paragraph is written in Monospace</p></li>
			<li><p class="cursive">This paragraph is written in Cursive</p></li>
			<li><p class="fantasy">This paragraph is written in Fantasy</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>It is good practice to write multiple fonts incase the browser does not support the font you specified. You can seperate each font with commas.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 align="Center">Font-Size</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Not only is there different font types, but there are also font sizes that<br />can be adjusted. There are key words that are used to adjust them:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p class="xx-small">xx-small</p></li>
			<li><p class="x-small">x-small</p></li>
			<li><p class="small">small</p></li>
			<li><p class="medium">medium</p></li>
			<li><p class="large">large</p></li>
			<li><p class="x-large">x-large</p></li>
			<li><p class="xx-large">xx-large</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Font sizes can be changed using pixels and ems. ems is another way<br> to manipulate the size of the texts. All major browsers will resize the texts<br> for you. If you havent already specified the font size, the em can be calculated. <br>Knowing that the default browser size is 16px the following can calculate the em:</p>

		<p>em=pixels/16</p>
