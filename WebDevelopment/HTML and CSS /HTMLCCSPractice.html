		<hr />

		<p>There are two types of font family names:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Font-Family</li>
			<li>Generic-Family</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The font-family is a specific font family like new times roman or arial.</p>
		<p>The generic-family is a group of font families with a similar look like serif or monospace.</p>

		<p>The following texts are written with generic family and font family fonts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p class="serif">This paragraph is written in Serif</p></li>
			<li><p class="sansserif">This paragraph is written in Sans-Serif</p></li>
			<li><p class="monospace">The paragraph is written in Monospace</p></li>
			<li><p class="cursive">This paragraph is written in Cursive</p></li>
			<li><p class="fantasy">This paragraph is written in Fantasy</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>It is good practice to write multiple fonts incase the browser does not support the font you specified. You can seperate each font with commas.</p>
